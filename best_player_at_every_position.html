<h1> <center>Quarterbacks</center></h1>


       <p> The Detroit Lions have had their fair share of quarterbacks throughout the years, but the best ones tend to be those who have made the biggest impact on the franchise’s success. Here are some of the top quarterbacks in Lions history:</p>

<p>Matthew Stafford (2009-2020)</p>

<p>Stafford is undoubtedly the best quarterback in Lions history. With a powerful arm and an ability to lead the team to multiple playoff appearances, he holds nearly every passing record for the franchise. Although the Lions never won a Super Bowl during his tenure, Stafford consistently put up impressive stats and was the franchise’s centerpiece for over a decade.</p>
<h3><center> honorable mentions</center></h3>
<p>Bobby Layne (1950-1958)</p>

<p>One of the most iconic figures in Lions history, Bobby Layne led the team to three NFL championships in the 1950s (1952, 1953, and 1957). Layne was known for his leadership, toughness, and ability to perform in big moments. He helped build the legacy of the Lions during their golden years.</p>
<p>Scott Mitchell (1994-1997)</p>

<p>While not as famous as Stafford or Layne, Scott Mitchell had some good years with the Lions. He set the franchise record for passing yards in a single season (4,338 in 1995), leading the team to a playoff appearance and a 12-4 record that year. His time with the Lions was relatively short, but he showed strong potential when healthy.</p>
<p>Greg Landry (1968-1978)</p>

<p>Greg Landry had a productive career with the Lions, especially known for his dual-threat ability. He was both a good passer and a capable runner, leading the Lions to playoff appearances. His strong arm and leadership on the field earned him recognition as one of the team’s better quarterbacks.</p>
<p>Charlie Batch (1998-2001)</p>

<p>Although Batch didn’t have a long career with the Lions, he was known for being a steady quarterback during a turbulent time for the team. He started some games and had success with the offense before later achieving more success as a backup with the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>


<p>David Krieg (1994) had a brief but decent stint with the Lions and helped stabilize the position for a short time.</p>
<p>Erik Kramer (1991-1994), known for some solid seasons with the Lions, especially in 1991 when the team went to the NFC Championship Game.</p>
<p> Jared Goff (2021-present) while still being in detroit goff has set himself as a amazing qb for them being one of the most accurate passers for them while still having time for them he maybe can dethrone stafford for then number 1 spot.

<p>These quarterbacks represent the best of what the Lions have had over the years. While none of them have led the team to a Super Bowl win, several of them were pivotal in building the franchise’s legacy.</p>


<h1> <center>Running Backs</center></h1>


<p>The best running back in Detroit Lions history is Barry Sanders, without a doubt. His combination of vision, agility, and electrifying playmaking ability set him apart not just as the best in Lions history, but as one of the greatest running backs in NFL history.</p>

While Barry Sanders remains the clear all-time best, the Lions have had a number of strong, impactful running backs throughout their history who have made their mark in various ways. Sanders, however, stands out for his consistent dominance, electrifying runs, and legacy as one of the all-time greats in NFL history.</p>


<h1><center>Wide Recivers</center></h1>

<p>The greatest wide receiver in Detroit Lions history is Calvin Johnson, also known as Megatron. Johnson's combination of size, speed, hands, and ability to dominate defenders makes him not only the best wide receiver in Lions history but also one of the best in NFL history.</p>

<p>Alworth only played a brief time with the Lions, but he was known for his quickness and ability to make big plays in the early days of the franchise. While his time was limited, he left an impact during his stint.
While Calvin Johnson is the undisputed best wide receiver in Lions history due to his outstanding skill set, dominance on the field, and overall impact, the team has had several notable receivers who played pivotal roles in the franchise’s history. However, none quite compare to the legacy that Megatron has left in Detroit.</p>

<p>11. Dan Campbell (2021–present) – Known for his passionate and motivational leadership style, Campbell’s Lions are in the process of rebuilding and are showing signs of improvement. Under his guidance, the team has become more competitive and displayed a tough, gritty playing style.</p>

<center>Offensive Cordinators</center>
</h2>	
<p> The Detroit Lions have had several offensive coordinators throughout their history, each bringing different styles and philosophies to the team's offensive play. Here’s a summary of key offensive coordinators for the Lions:</p>

<p>1. Tommy Hudspeth (1956–1961) – Hudspeth was the Lions' offensive coordinator during the late 1950s and early 1960s, including their 1957 NFL Championship season. His offensive schemes were effective at the time, particularly the passing game, helping the Lions remain competitive.</p>

<p>2. George Wilson (1962–1964) – After serving as the head coach, Wilson also took on offensive coordinator duties. His leadership during this period helped the Lions remain a strong team in the early 1960s.</p>

<p>3. Dave Levy (1970–1972) – Levy was the offensive coordinator during the early 1970s. His tenure saw moderate offensive success, but the Lions struggled to compete with other NFC teams in that era.</p>

<p>4. Marty Mornhinweg (1995–1996) – Before becoming the head coach, Mornhinweg served as the offensive coordinator under Wayne Fontes. Mornhinweg’s playcalling helped elevate the Lions’ offense, particularly in the passing game, during the mid-1990s.</p>

<p>5. Gary Moeller (1997–2000) – Moeller took over as offensive coordinator after Mornhinweg’s departure, running an offense that emphasized both the passing and running games. His time with the Lions featured inconsistency, but the offense showed some flashes of improvement.</p>

<p>6. Mike Martz (2006) – Martz, known for his “Greatest Show on Turf” offense with the St. Louis Rams, was hired to bring a high-powered passing attack to Detroit. Though his system produced some offensive production, it also led to confusion and struggles with the offensive line, and Martz left after one season.</p>

<p>7. Scott Linehan (2007–2008) – Linehan’s time as the Lions’ offensive coordinator was marked by mixed results, with the offense struggling to find consistency, especially under a poor offensive line. Linehan was fired after the team’s disastrous 0-16 season in 2008.</p>

<p>8. Jim Colletto (2009) – Colletto served as the offensive coordinator under head coach Jim Schwartz. His system relied heavily on the run game and featured a more conservative approach. The Lions' offense still struggled during this period, and Colletto was let go after one season.</p>

<p>9. Scott Linehan (2010) – Linehan returned to the Lions as offensive coordinator after his earlier stint, and his tenure brought improved results, particularly in the passing game. He worked with quarterback Matthew Stafford and helped the team score more points, though the offense was still inconsistent.</p>

<p>10. Lynn Molnar (2011–2013) – Molnar served as the offensive coordinator in the early 2010s, helping the Lions' offense perform at a relatively high level. He worked with quarterback Matthew Stafford and led the offense to several productive seasons, though the team’s overall performance was inconsistent.</p>

<p>11. Joe Lombardi (2014–2015) – Lombardi, a former New Orleans Saints assistant coach, brought his West Coast offense to the Lions. However, his pass-heavy approach did not result in long-term success, leading to his departure after two seasons.</p>

<p>12. Jim Bob Cooter (2015–2018) – Cooter was one of the more popular offensive coordinators in recent Lions history. His offense was more creative and quarterback-friendly, with a strong emphasis on short passing. Under his leadership, the offense was more dynamic, and he helped quarterback Matthew Stafford have some of his best seasons.</p>

<p>13. Darrell Bevell (2019–2020) – Bevell, who had been the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks, took over the role for the Lions in 2019. His offensive system was built on the running game, with some success in developing a balanced offense. However, despite occasional flashes of effectiveness, the offense did not take off as hoped, and he was dismissed after the 2020 season.</p>

<p>14. Antwaan Randle El (2021) – Randle El served as the passing game coordinator for the Lions, focusing more on developing the wide receivers and passing schemes as part of the team's broader offensive approach under Dan Campbell. He brought a fresh perspective but did not hold the primary coordinator role.</p>

<p>15. Ben Johnson (2021–present) – Johnson, who became the offensive coordinator in 2022, has overseen a resurgence in the Lions' offense. Under his guidance, the team has had one of the league’s top offensive units, with a creative and explosive scheme built around quarterback Jared Goff and running back Jahmyr Gibbs. His focus on both the passing and running game has helped the Lions become one of the most balanced and efficient offenses in the NFL.</p>

<p>Each offensive coordinator has faced challenges in Detroit, from changing quarterbacks to weak rosters, but the Lions' offense has found more stability and success in recent years with Ben Johnson at the helm.</p>

		<center>Defensive Cordinators</center>
	</h2>
<p>The Detroit Lions have had a variety of defensive coordinators over the years, each with their own strategies and approaches to improving the team’s defense. Here's a summary of some of the key defensive coordinators in the team's history:</p>

<p>1. George Wilson (1957–1964)
George Wilson was also the head coach for the Lions and served as their defensive coordinator during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Under his leadership, the Lions won the NFL Championship in 1957, with a strong defensive unit that helped keep the team competitive during that era.</p>

<p>2. Joe Schmidt (1967–1972)
Joe Schmidt, a former Lions linebacker, was not only a legendary player but also served as the team's defensive coordinator. Under his leadership, the Lions’ defense remained tough and competitive in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>

<p>3. Monte Clark (1976–1984)
While head coach, Monte Clark also had a significant influence on the Lions' defense. Clark brought a disciplined, physical approach to the defense, but the team's success on that side of the ball was inconsistent during his tenure.</p>

<p>4. Wayne Fontes (1988–1996)
Wayne Fontes was the Lions' head coach, but during his time, the team had several defensive coordinators. The defense had a solid reputation for being tough, but it struggled against high-powered offenses during the 1990s.</p>

<p>5. Nick Saban (2000–2004)
Before becoming the head coach at Alabama, Nick Saban served as the Lions' defensive coordinator. Saban’s tenure brought a focus on building a tough defense, and while there were some promising aspects, the Lions were still rebuilding at the time.</p>

<p>6. Rodolfo "Rod" Marinelli (2006–2008)
Rod Marinelli, also the head coach, took an active role in developing the defense, particularly focusing on the defensive line. However, the defense struggled during the 0-16 season in 2008, and Marinelli's defensive schemes did not have the desired effect.</p>

<p>7. Jim Schwartz (2009–2013)
Jim Schwartz is remembered for bringing a more aggressive, blitz-heavy defense to the Lions. His tenure saw some success with the defense, including a playoff appearance in 2011. Schwartz emphasized a physical, in-your-face style, but his defense often lacked consistency.</p>

<p>8. Gunther Cunningham (2006–2008, 2010–2013)
Gunther Cunningham served as both a defensive coordinator under Rod Marinelli and later, after Schwartz took over, he was rehired in 2010. His defenses were often solid but lacked playmakers and could not consistently match the team's offensive output.</p>

<p>9. Teryl Austin (2014–2017)
Teryl Austin brought a more disciplined and structured approach to the Lions' defense. His tenure included the development of a strong secondary and linebacker corps, and his defense helped lead the team to multiple playoff appearances. However, Austin's defense was often criticized for being too passive, especially in critical moments.</p>

<p>10. Matt Patricia (2018–2020)
After being hired as head coach, Matt Patricia, who had previously been the defensive coordinator for the New England Patriots, took over the defense in Detroit. Patricia’s defense was a hybrid scheme focused on versatility and flexibility, but his tenure was plagued by inconsistent performances and poor results, leading to his firing after three seasons.</p>

<p>11. Corey Undlin (2020–2021)
Corey Undlin took over as the defensive coordinator under head coach Dan Campbell in 2021. His defense was known for being young and rebuilding, focusing on developing players rather than immediate results. However, the Lions' defense struggled overall during this period, especially against the run.</p>

<p>12. Aaron Glenn (2021–present)
Aaron Glenn, a former NFL cornerback, took over as the defensive coordinator in 2021 under head coach Dan Campbell. Glenn has transformed the Lions’ defense by introducing a more aggressive, fast-paced approach, focusing on versatility and creating turnovers. While the defense is still a work in progress, there have been clear signs of improvement, especially in terms of player development and overall competitiveness. The Lions’ defense showed considerable growth in 2023, leading to optimism for the future.</p>

<p>Each defensive coordinator has left their mark on the Lions, but the team has often struggled to maintain consistency on defense. Under Aaron Glenn, the defense seems to be on the rise, with a renewed focus on building a balanced, aggressive, and youthful unit.</p>

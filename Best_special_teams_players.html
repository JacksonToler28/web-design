<h1><center>Best_Punter</center></h1>


<p>Sam Martin</p>

<p>The best punter of all time for the Detroit Lions is widely considered to be Sam Martin. He played for the Lions from 2013 to 2019 and left a strong mark on the franchise. Over his six seasons with Detroit, Martin became known for his consistent and impressive punting ability. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2017, showing his excellence at the position, and was one of the most reliable punters in the NFL during his time with the Lions.</p>

<p>Honorable Mentions:</p>

<p>Jim Arnold (1987–1996)</p>

<p>Arnold had a long career with the Lions and was a steady presence. He averaged 42.9 yards per punt during his tenure with Detroit and became the team's all-time leader in punting yards for a while. Jim was known for his ability to flip field position and was highly dependable during his 10 seasons with the Lions.</p>

<p>Craig Hentrich (1993–1994)</p>

<p>Though he didn’t have a long tenure with the Lions (just two seasons), Hentrich's strong leg and overall solid punting performance earned him an honorable mention. He went on to have a lengthy career with the Tennessee Titans after leaving Detroit, further cementing his status as a top-tier punter in the NFL.</p>

<p>While Sam Martin stands out as the best, these honorable mentions are also key figures who contributed to the Lions' special teams over the years.</p>

<h1><center>Best Kicker</center></h1>

<p>The title of best kicker in Detroit Lions history is often given to Jason Hanson, who had an illustrious career with the team. Here's a closer look at Hanson and some honorable mentions.</p>

<p>Jason Hanson (1992-2012)</p>

<p>Jason Hanson is undoubtedly the best kicker in Detroit Lions history and one of the most consistent kickers in NFL history. He spent his entire 21-season career with the Lions (1992-2012), earning a spot as one of the league's all-time greats. His longevity, accuracy, and reliability on both field goals and extra points made him a staple of the Lions' special teams.

Career Stats:
2,150 points scored (most in franchise history).
495 field goals made (3rd most in NFL history at the time of his retirement).
83.2% career field goal accuracy.
5-time Pro Bowl selection and 2-time All-Pro (1997, 1999).
Notable for his performance in clutch moments, including his 5-for-5 effort in the snow against the Eagles in 1995.</p>

<p>Honorable Mentions:</p>

<p>Morten Andersen</p>

<p>While Andersen is best known for his career with the New Orleans Saints, he played his final two seasons (2010-2011) with the Detroit Lions. During his brief tenure in Detroit, he still managed to leave a mark, hitting some crucial kicks. However, his time in Detroit was limited, and his overall legacy was established in New Orleans.

Career Stats: Andersen is the NFL's all-time leader in points scored and field goals made.</p>

<p>Eddie Murray</p>

<p>Eddie Murray was the Lions' kicker for a decade (1980-1991). He was another reliable and steady presence for the team during the 1980s and early 1990s. Murray had a solid career and was one of the best kickers in the league during his time, earning a Pro Bowl selection in 1991. He had the longest tenure of any Lions kicker before Hanson.

Career Stats: Murray made 60% of his field goals over his career with the Lions and was known for his consistency in pressure situations.</p>

<p>While Jason Hanson is undoubtedly the best kicker in Detroit Lions history, players like Eddie Murray and Matt Prater also made significant contributions during their time with the franchise. However, Hanson's career-long success, franchise records, and consistency cement his place as the all-time best.</p>
